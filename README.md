## Instructions for installing OpenMC  
  
If you use Linux or Mac OS X, follow these instructions: https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/quickinstall.html  

If you use Windows, follow these steps:
1. Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux by following these instructions (install Ubuntu in Step 6): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
2. Double-click the Ubuntu icon and follow the 'Installing from Source on Ubuntu 15.04+' and 'Installing from Source on Linux or Mac OS X' instructions: https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/quickinstall.html  
3. Alternatively, you can follow the Docker instructions, but I've found that some students have issues installing and running Docker.
